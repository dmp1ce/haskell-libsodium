libsodium Haskell bindings
==========================

Bindings to libsodium for Haskell.

The purpose of this library is to expose libsodium to Haskell applications. This library does not try to protect the developer from using libsodium incorrectly, so it is important to understand how to use libsodium. Refer to the [libsodium documentation](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/). Also, see the haddock documentation and tests for examples on how to use these bindings.

**This library is not production-ready and should not be used for purposes
where cryptographic failure may endanger anyone's life, liberty or pursuit of
happiness.**
